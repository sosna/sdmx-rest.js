# How to contribute

First of all, a **heartfelt thank you** for your willingness to contribute to this project!

We'll gladly accept any pull request but we'd appreciate it if the following recommendations could be followed, as they make our _review_ work easier.

- For any non-trivial issue, it is useful to first **create an issue**. This is merely to allow any non-trivial change to be discussed before proceeding.
- Please add tests and **check the test coverage** with `npm run coverage`.
- Please check that you have **adhered the coding guidelines** by running `npm run lint`.
